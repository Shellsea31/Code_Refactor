# Code_Refactor
01 Homework - Code Refactor:

In this assignment I was tasked to refactor a given code without changing the original appearance. To refactor code means to upgrade the syntax by adding necessary comments, deleting and merging classes and renaming "div" to "section" "nav" or "main" to make the code easier to read. This also meant adding alt attributes to images, making them accessible to visitors with disabilities.
